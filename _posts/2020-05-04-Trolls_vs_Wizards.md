# Trolls vs. Wizards

We live in interesting times. On the one hand, social media drives public discourse into polarized
shouting matches. Astroturfing bots contort the information landscape by pushing false narratives
on Twitter with incendiary, ill-informed talking points. The ease of web-publishing makes it relatively easy to 
drown out informative scientific work by spreading misinformation in coordinated online media campaigns. 

But also, tech advances drive public engagement and citizen scientists contribute directly to research more 
than ever before. It's easier to any number of technically-demanding subjects with 
Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). The information infrastructure of science itself is evolving 
to change and accelerate the path towards discovery. 

These two aspects are sharply opposed. The first approach is based on misinformation, manipulation, provocation,
and storytelling. Let's call the instigators of such methods '[Trolls](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=troll)'.
The second approach is based on expertise, hard work, and a nuanced view of reality in order to find 
effective explanations for real phenomena. This work requires diligence, honesty, intelligence, and patience. 
Let's call anyone pursuing this endeavor 'Wizards'. Thus, I frame this argument as the perrenial struggle between
wizards and trolls. 

### How to fight trolls - a wizard's field guide. 

Scientific discussions are typically based on *abductive reasoning*: 
argument from evidence to the best available explanation. In the blood sport where 
teams of trolls strive to defeat their opponents by any means necessary, the meagre 
weapons of abductive reasoning can do little to withstand the assault of scorn, derision, 
and '[bullshit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit)'. 

But, knowledge is power. *Science is, after all, very much like magic.* Science is the basis 
for technology, and try as they might, trolls cannot accomplish anything remotely as powerful. 
They can sway public opinion, but they cannot cure disease or prevent natural disasters. 
They cannot send ships into space or understand the mysteries of fluid dynamics in the upper 
stratosphere. 
 
We must enable the explanatory power of scientific 
knowledge to address these counter-arguments as explicitly and powerfully as possible. 
At present, the scientific community does not possess the necessary power to challenge the trolls. 
This is was best said by Ben Goldacre in the last chapter of his book '[Bad Science: Quacks, Hacks, 
and Big Pharma Flacks](https://books.google.com/books?id=rDT9MO0r0UYC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false)'. He writes:

> <small>*"To anyone who feels their ideas have been challenged by this book or who has been made 
angry by it - to the people who feature in it, I suppose - I would say this: **you win**. You really 
do. I would hope that there might be room for you to reconsider, to change your stancein 
the light of what might be new information (as I will happily do, if there is ever an opportunity 
to update this book). But you will not need to because, as we both know, you collectively have 
almost full spectrum dominance. Your ideas - bogus though they may be - have immense superficial
plausibility, they can be expressed rapidly, they are endlessly repeated, and they are believed 
by enough people for you to make very comfortable livings and to have enormous cultural influence.
You win."*</small>

Personally, I am not comfortable with this easy capitulation. I prefer to take a leaf out of
 Gandalf's playbook even when faced with a daunting powerful foe.

Countering the troll 'full spectrum dominance' will require the development of 
transformative approaches to remove barriers that laypeople experience in 
understanding complex scientific concepts. We will need to make the work more 
inclusive and more democratic. We may need to transform the way scientists work 
and the way science is taught. This will require impeccability, creativity, 
honesty, and courage. 

### Data Science Wizardry 

So, here are some observations and strategies to consider going forward. 

1. Modern information technology is changing many aspects of scientific work, creating new opportunities 
and paradigms. Amongst these methods include: 
    * The scalability and speed of 'big data' systems allows easy analysis of very large data sets
    * Deep learning and modern machine-learning methods provide groundbreaking AI performance in tasks 
    like Data mining, Natural Language Processing, Image Classification and Document Processing. 
    * In particular, deep reinforcement learning permits robots and automated systems to win games 
    and learn complex behaviors
    * Forecasting methods provide powerful new methods of generating predictions based on data.
    * Social Media research permits us to track and understand some of the impact of misinformation 
    in society.
    * Science information infrastructure is beginning to provide systems for reproducibility, scalability and 
    increased rigor such as Workflows, Ontologies, Information Integration systems. 
    * A key capabilty is tracking the provenance of knowledge: *What is the evidence that supports our 
    argument that a given claim is true?*. This is an area of continuing, active research. 
    * Creative methods for data visualization are becoming more common and more powerful. 
2. Attempts where scientists have adopted 'trollish' methods failed spectacularly. 
    * When climate researchers in England attempted to convert their scientific perspective into 
a political strategy, leaks of their emails that revealed their attempts to construct a robust and compelling 
poitical argument involved ham-fisted attempts to silence critics and steer the conversation. 'Climategate' 
ensued, doing real and lasting harm both to the climate change debate and also to the credibility of 
academics as a whole. 
    * More recently, attempts to create an expedient, powerful, simple talking point was
the often-quoted 'climate consensus' figure. This was the product of a 2014 paper that boldly states: 
*"Among self-rated papers expressing a position on AGW (anthropogenic global warming), 97.2% endorsed the consensus"* 
[(ref: Cook et al 2014)](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024/pdf).
Unfortunately, even a simple review of this study's own data,
reveals vulnerabilities in the study that are easily revealed, see this blog post: 
['a climate falsehood you can check yourself'](http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2014/02/a-climate-falsehood-you-can-check-for.html). 
Attempting to use the dark arts of spin when creating a scientifically-driven policy argument is a bad idea. 
    * At the 2017 White House Correspondents Dinner, Hasan Minhaj said "We're living in this 
    strange time, when ***trust is more important than truth***". ([video](https://youtu.be/Of6PLJbMnxE?t=12m45s)). 
    We have to find ways to establish trustworthiness with people who currently don't believe the 
    research and choose instead to grasp, easy-to-understand, wrong answers.  
3. Currently, the most accessible repository of the world's scientific knowledge
is the scientific literature. This provides a valuable resource for knowledge engineering work 
and building models of what is reported in the literature can provide insight into the underlying
subject and influence public opinion.  
    * As a human endeavor, the scientific literature is far from ideal. [People routinely game the system](https://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b2680)  
    to promote their own research, usually with honest intentions but sometimes not.
    * Systems such as [CZI's Meta](https://meta.org), [scite.ai](http://scite.ai/), [AI2's Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) and others
    use AI to improve and enable scientists' interactions with the literature. These tools are generally open access, 
    and collaborate to enable and support each other.
4. Beyond scientist-facing work, there are also other related efforts attempting to render aspects of public
  life more fact-based and data-driven. This provides a working community of data-providers, developers and end-users as 
    well as possible frameworks for increasing the scope and impact of technology in multiple areas. 
    * [The FORCE11 group ('Future Of Research Communication and E-Scholarship)](https://www.force11.org) 
     is a wide-ranging academic / industry community with a broad mandate to bring about the 
     transformation of scientific communication. 
    * ['Solutions Journalism'](http://solutionsjournalism.org/) provides a powerful appraoch to communicating 
uncomfortable issues to the public. By surveying how problems are being solved and then framing discussions 
of difficult subjects, propopents of this approach have shown that members of the public are more engaged 
and receptive to reporting when framed in this way. Such an approach could work well for how we communicate 
the application of scientific methods to policy. 
   * Steve Ballmer, the ex-CEO of Microsoft, has financed and driven ['USA Facts'](https://usafacts.org/), 
   a website that examines the financial 'score card' of the United States as if it were a business. 
   A recent Freakonomics podcast (['Hoopers! Hoopers! Hoopers!'](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/hoopers-hoopers-hoopers/))
   showcased this interesting project and dealt briefly with the subject of outcomes and how 
   one might measure them. This is the purview of the social sciences and likely requires some 
   expertise from within the field of education theory or psychology to really 
   * A number of non-profits have similar missions: ['Data 4 America'](https://data4america.org/about/) 
   is one such organization. 
3. The public are very receptive to scientific content when it is presented in a compelling and interesting way. 
    * Organizations such as [the Technology Entertainment Design (TED)
conference](http://www.ted.com/) are massively popular and provide an excellent template for packaging and 
presenting complex and compelling scientific ideas. 
    * Blogs such as framework Radiolab, Science Friday and Freakanomics regularly describe new scientific 
    developments in a public forum with great results. 
    * MOOCs (such as [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)) and online courses provide a wide range of 
    course material to teach complex subjects. 'Science Driven Public Policy' could be a subject that we 
    could develop and teach. 
    * Citizen science projects (such as [Galaxy Zoo](https://www.galaxyzoo.org/) and 
    [FoldIt](https://fold.it/portal/)) permit members of the public to directly
    contribute to the scientific endeavor. This is interesting, fun, educational and could be a vehicle for 
    engagement for science-driven policy.
    * Academics typically present their ideas as powerpoint slides, but animation and storytelling methods
    could better illustrate their work to the public. An excellent example of this technique is 
    [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9R6jgE7SQ) by Pindex describing the Dunning Kruger effect 
    (and narrated by Stephen Fry).
    * It is important to note that metaphor and analogy are crucial tools that help translate complex 
    scientific ideas into commonsense language. Finding the right framework for this messaging is an 
    important aspect of this communication. 
4. We must recognize that this is an *adversarial situation* where our opponents will use literally 
every rhetorical trick to counter a scientifically-defined viewpoint. We must counter the trolls directly 
by understanding, unpacking and attacking their arguments. We should do so explicitly, ruthlessly and with as much 
transparency and authority as possible. 
    * A terrific example of how the trolls work is the PragerU, right wing 'educational' website. Consider 
    [this anti-climate change video](https://www.facebook.com/prageru/videos/1355076144535238/?fref=mentions) 
    which attempts to debunk the Cook et al 2014 consensus paper. Some of the arguments are nonsensical 
    (including an absurd apparent attempt to appeal to an antivaccination argument), but some 
    carry a little more weight. The production of the video and carries the listener through the logic of 
    the argument well, making emphatic statements that boldy bullshit the listener to serve their underlying 
    argument. To counter this, we should analyze, deconstruct and refute their argument, perhaps in 
    the same format but with a great deal of underlying support from data and established existing research.   
    * The work of [Walton *et al.* 2013](https://www.amazon.com/Argumentation-Schemes-Douglas-Walton/dp/0521723744) on
    *Argumentation Schemes* provide a fascinating theoretical framework for formalizing how arguments are put together.
    This is an approach widely used in developing AI-support tools for legal argumentation, but could well be applied 
    here. 
7. Finally, Computational Social Network Sciences is a powerful emerging field of AI research, that can 
provide insight in the emerging online world of politics.  Colleages such [Emilio Ferrara](http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/press-coverage/)
 and [Kristina Lerman](http://www.isi.edu/integration/people/lerman/index.html) study how people interact with
 policy through social media, social bots and each other. Understanding the dynamics of these interactions could be crucially valuable in 
 developing effective technological strategies.

### What can we do? 

Our goal would be to enable the use of innovative, cutting edge, AI research within the context of 
policy development. Our strategy for doing this would be by developing methods to leverage 
and utilize scientific expertise and knowledge in politcally-relevant situations. If we could also
better understand the rhetorical positions of identifiably-anti-scientific positions within 
public discourse. If we understand our adversaries, then we can defeat them more easily. 

An initial pilot effort could be to re-examine the scientific literature described in the Cook 
et al. 2014 consensus study by developing detailed semantic models of the data being cited in those 
papers. Our job is to explore and explain the science to the public: exploring, explaining and 
educating through accurate reporting of the abudictive reasoning used to understand what 
is going on. We may explicitly contrast our approach to that of non-scientific arguments being 
made but always from the point of view of educating people to think scientifically, and never 
engaging in a polemic, fruitless discussion. If a climate-skeptic cites counterevidence, we will 
attempt to understand it rationally and scientifically. After all, as scientists we want people 
to poke holes in our models and find their flaws. Here, we would welcome such things with 
politeness and appreciation. 

Multiple challenges threaten this plan:

1. **Scientific work is complex, difficult to understand and challenging to execute.** In order to
be able to execute their work well at all, scientists perform technical feats that are 
difficult to record accurately, let alone reproduce. Work in the field of semantic E-Science (including
ontological modeling and workflow development) make it possible to reproduce even very 
complex data analytics, given the additional time and effort required to model them.

2. **There is a lot of knowledge to work through.** curating information from the literature is a 
slow and laborious process (especially since scientific arguments do not tolerate errors well). 
Developing methods of automation of the curation task may speed up how representations can be 
 populated. Needless to say, this is an area of active research and might form the basis of 
 a focused study on the climate change literature. 

3. **Communicating complex scientific ideas is difficult.** The popular science media community
provides a vehicle to do this through magazines, podcasts, books, television and other media. 
Relying on these traditional methods can only go so far. Data visualization methods can 
provide a far more compelling and exhaustive view of a complex subject. [This astonishing representation of the casulties of WWII](https://vimeo.com/128373915) 
is an example of a series of data visualizations that tell a compelling story in a linear fashion. 
We may need to examine new, non-linear methods to explain and explore the complexities of the subject of
climate change.

4. **Engaging people in this endeavor requires us to go beyond simple research.** For this work to have 
an impact, we will require outreach and involvement far beyond the simple development of novel technology. 

In 'the Martian', an incredible movie about a lone astronaut marooned on Mars, he [says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BABM3EUo990):

> In face of overwhelming odds, I'm left with only one option. I'm going to have to  science the s*** out of this.

Clearly, this is the situation we all find ourselves in now, and 
[all unnecessary Tolkein references aside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmDT2BgI-0), solid science, honesty, and 
hard work are only things that can solve challenges like COVID-19, Rare Disease, Neurodegenerative Disease, and maybe 
even things like income inequality, homelessness, and poverty. 

This is work for Wizards, let's go.
