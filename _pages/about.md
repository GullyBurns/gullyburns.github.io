I'm Gully. It's a cool name. My parents gave me the moniker from a character in a 1950s 'pulp' science fiction novel 
called '[The Stars My Destination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stars_My_Destination)'.    

I studied physics as an undergraduate at Imperial College in London, and loved the mathematical precision of the models and the quantitative certainty it was possible to enjoy with physical models of reality. When you're thinking about conservation of mass energy, the speed of light or Planck's constant, you always have a strong feeling of the stability of your foundations.  

On the 3<sup>rd</sup> of December 1991 at about 10:13am (halfway through a quite boring lecture on subatomic particle detectors) I decided, quite suddenly, to study how the brain works. Little did I know when I started a doctorate at Oxford on '[Neural Connectivity in the Rat Brain](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1323181)', that I was effectively throwing that foundation away. Neuroscience is quite messy, complex and heterogeneous and I found the best way of making sense of it was to attempt to apply a phyics-like modeling approach to the concepts used by my colleagues and simply develop databases and tools to bring together how neural circuits work. 
 
As a postdoc, I moved to Los Angeles and started working for Larry Swanson, a world-leading neuroanatomist.  I did some wet-lab experimental neuroscience work, but took my prior work and started to develop knowledge management tools for neuroscientists. We built an open source knowledge management platform for the neuroscience literature called `NeuroScholar', and embarked on a research career that largely centered around developing good high-level research ideas that translated to funding.   

The second pivot in my career was to move to [USC's Information Sciences Institute](https://www.isi.edu) in 2006. In collaboration with specialist CS faculty and students with expertise in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Knowledge Representation, Information Integration, Workflows, Semantic Web, I developed projects, won grants, and   drove a high-level research program that brought in funding, and made progress. My role was high-level, and most of the cutting-edge data science was performed by students under the direction of my CS colleagues. For me, this always lead, inevitbly, to a sense of powerlessness. These were not my students; and my CS collegues always focused on the CS research in their own subdomains rather than the applied  goals of a Scientific Knowledge Engineering perspective.   

In the second half of 2018, I had the opportunity of joining the [the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/) (CZI).  I was especially struck by how [their vision of how science works](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=9310487837114270) seemed to reflect exactly how I saw the same challenge as the driving force behind my work up to that point.  I left academida and joined CZI to work at the cutting edge between Tech and Philanthropy as a data scientist.  Now, my work is down-in-the-weeds and striving to finding working solutions for our team as we develop tools to help scientists accelerate their work. 

It is thrilling to be at the bleeding edge, especially now. It is at this time in history when the stakes could not be higher in terms of both scientific and sociological challenges to science as an  endeavor. We must raise ourselves up, rapidly solve deadly problems that we face and do so with perfect integrity and grace.       

In addition to my work, I love to write and maintain a blog called '[Ars Veritatis - the Art of Truth](http://ars-veritatis.blogspot.com/)'. Beyond that, I am a proud husband and father.
