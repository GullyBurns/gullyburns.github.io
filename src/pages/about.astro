      <p>
        I'm Gully — named after a character in a 1950s pulp sci-fi novel,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stars_My_Destination" class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Stars My Destination</em></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I studied physics at Imperial College London, drawn to the mathematical precision
        of physical models. The certainty was comforting — conservation laws, fundamental
        constants, solid ground.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then I pivoted to neuroscience, and never felt that secure about my knowledge again.
        The brain is messy, complex, heterogeneous. I found the best way to make sense of it
        was to build databases and tools — to model not neurons, but the concepts my colleagues
        used to describe them.
      </p>

      <p>
        This led me to USC's Information Sciences Institute, where I collaborated with experts
        in NLP, knowledge representation, and semantic web technologies. My role was to
        translate between domains — to find the common structure underlying scientific knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then, I pivoted from academia to industry by joining the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative in 2018. 
        Since then, I worked on tools to read the scientific literature, rare disease patient screening, 
        and more recently agentic approaches to biocuration - converting the complex messy reality you 
        find out there in the world into something concrete, usable, and powerful.   
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Now I work at the intersection of AI and science, building tools to help researchers
        accelerate their work. It's the fulfillment of a career spent asking: how do we
        transform information into understanding?
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond work, My universe is joyfully filled with being a proud husband and father. 
        I think about truth and epistemology with some writings titled 'Ars Veritatis' (Latin for 'The Art of Truth').
        I write poetry and use AI to translate them into music.
        I play (and write) tabletop RPGs using the excellent Mythras system. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe the world can't wait for us to solve the problems we face.
