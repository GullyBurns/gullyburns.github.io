At a high level, my work centers on the following construct:

I gave a talk in 2013 to the 'International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility' (INCF) in Stockholm and described my viewpoint and approach at that time \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPlBejxhLJg&t=0)\] and laid out how I was attempting to develop tools and systems that tackled the parts of the cycle that seemed tractable, namely representations of experimental design. When describing how we might attempt to deal with the expert-level interpretive knowledge, somewhat presciently, I said that it was impossible 'until we develop an AI capable of doing science'. 

We are now at that point. 

I think that the KQED construct is still useful by requiring that we think of the different steps of the process distinctly. It is also crucial to remember that these cycles of scientific work typically occur within a given experimental paradigm - often using expertise or tools that are only understood by people from within that paradigm. 

My hope is that if we can leverage these elements into our use of AI agents and models in these domains, we'll be much better at developing fully-fledged AI scientists that we can really dive into. 

We're just getting started.
