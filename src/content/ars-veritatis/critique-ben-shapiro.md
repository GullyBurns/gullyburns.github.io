Just before Charlie Kirk's assassination, Ezra Klein talked to Ben Shapiro about his new book in which he outlines a two-sided framework for politics based on differentiating between "lions"—those who build, innovate, and defend civilization—and "scavengers"—those driven by grievance who tear down institutions. In my attempt to argue constructively with people on the opposite side of the political spectrum, I will here attempt to critique Mr. Shapiro's perspective as portrayed in this conversation 

*(note, I will not attempt to discuss the book itself, merely his conversation about the book with Ezra Klein). *

## The core of Shapiro's argument is a truism that he strives to weaponize. 

First off, it is a truism to say that personal responsibility matters. Shapiro frequently points in the discussion that his distinction between 'Lions' and 'Scavengers' does not necessarily follow Right- or  Left-wing politics and reading his interpretation generously, his distinction could be considered as scavengers are those who 'complain unproductively' and as lions are those who 'find solutions'. 

He rightly points out that a viable political strategy is driven by harnessing grievance about life's unfairness and direct that energy toward resentment and anger rather than solutions. I agree that we  certainly should encourage people to take ownership of what they can control in their lives. Most conservatives and liberals agree on this. We want people to work hard, support their families, and contribute to their communities. The disagreement isn't about whether personal responsibility matters—it's about how we understand the obstacles people face and what role *policy* should play in addressing them. 

Shapiro himself says in the interview that his job is *"to get the obstacles out of people's way so that they can succeed or fail based on their own merits". * His insistence that we live in society that is the most prosperous and most free that has ever existed (and that this is driven by 'private ownership') is a false claim. There are economic inequalities in US society not driven by meritocracy but other factors (such as long-term consequences of racism - see Appendix A), and that economic discrepancies are growing (see Appendix B). 

Shapiro condemns anyone raising their voice about attempting to address the unfairness of this situation as a 'scavenger' - and then uses the harshest language possible to decry them. In particular, he calls Bernie Sanders, a "putrescent Marxist pimple" who has "never created a damn thing." Sanders has been a mayor, congressman, and senator for decades. He's gotten community health center funding into law. He's been remarkably consistent about specific policy goals: Medicare for All, higher minimum wages, stronger unions. You can disagree with these policies, but they're not "envious scavenging"—they're policy preferences backed by arguments about how society could what would improve people's lives. When Klein points this out, Shapiro's says Sanders "maligns [wealthy people] as morally inferior" and asks "when you cross that $999,999,999 mark, is that when you become evil?" But Sanders isn't making a moral argument about individual billionaires—he's making a structural argument about how concentrated wealth translates into political power that shapes policy in ways that don't serve most people. Sanders does engage a moralistic language to argue his point, but does so based on the idea of the unfairness of aspects of private ownership and harm to hardworking citizens. The fact that this contradicts Shapiro's core premise is likely the reason he despises Sanders so much.  

This is the core problem with the framework: it treats any structural critique as evidence of "scavenger mentality." But saying "our tax code advantages wealth over labor" or "our housing policy has inflated asset values for owners while pricing out buyers" isn't scavenging—it's describing policy choices that could be different based on different strategic choices.

## **Demonizing language and mischaracterizing empathy**

Furthermore, it's notable that Shapiro's language around is dehumanizing and reductive — he gleefully uses terms like 'looters', 'lechers', and 'barbarians', and attributes the motivations of such people in the worst possible terms. When campus protesters stand up for Palestinians, or when Bernie Sanders fights for universal healthcare, or when Ferguson residents protest police conduct, Shapiro sees only 'scavengers' driven by envy. He makes no effort to understand how these people see themselves - as defending the vulnerable, fighting injustice, protecting their communities.

This isn't just an analytical failure - it's a moral one. The same empathy Shapiro extends to conservative grievances disappears when confronting liberal ones. He can understand why rural Americans feel abandoned by globalization, but not why Black parents fear for their children during police encounters. He validates feeling threatened by 'wokeness' but dismisses feeling threatened by police violence.

Klein's most devastating point: Shapiro claims Western civilization is built on Judeo-Christian values, but those very traditions emphasize care for the poor, the widow, the stranger. 'Blessed are the meek' isn't scavenger ideology - it's in the Sermon on the Mount. The prophetic tradition in Judaism is largely about calling out injustice and defending the vulnerable.

By treating any structural critique as 'scavenger mentality,' Shapiro isn't defending Western civilization's values - he's betraying them.

## A lack of consistency around Trump

Shapiro's framework has another serious issue: by his own admission, Donald Trump engages in exactly the kind of grievance politics he criticizes. Trump's entire pitch to voters has been "you got screwed"—by trade deals, by immigrants, by elites who look down on you. His economic policies, particularly on tariffs, are explicitly premised on the idea that the system is rigged against American workers. 

Shapiro acknowledges this directly. When Klein asks if Trump pulled the right into scavenger mentality, Shapiro says: "I think with regard to sort of a populist economics. Yes." He admits Trump's approach "has aspects that are more scavenger-like." He concedes that Trump's policies have shrunk the power of Congress and that he has engaged in attacking his political enemies. 

Yet Shapiro voted for Trump twice and campaigned for him. His explanation? Trump delivers on other priorities—judges, Israel policy, opposition to DEI. This is honest, but it reveals that the "lions versus scavengers" framework does not matter that much when raw political power is involved. 

Furthermore, it reveals severe inconsistencies when scrutinized critically. He claims that there is a stronger focus on 'meritocracy' rather than DEI, but the determining factor for success in Trump's adminstration is only blind loyalty to Trump - under any and all circumstances. This is born out by consideration of the composition of Trump's cabinet and his stated policy throughout his administration (See Appendix C).  

## Right wing grievances 

Shapiro's discussion of history is perhaps the most interesting aspect of the discussion (especially when considered in conjunction with his commentary of events whilst they are happening). When Shapiro discusses the Obama years,  he cites several moments that right wingers felt Obama was "divisive":

**The Henry Louis Gates incident**: A Black Harvard professor is arrested in his own home after showing ID to police. Obama says the police "acted stupidly." Shapiro's interpretation: This shows Obama saw everything through a racial lens and was being divisive.

**Trayvon Martin**: Obama expresses empathy for grieving parents, saying "If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon." Shapiro's interpretation: This was polarizing and suggested Black Americans are "inherently victimized by a white supremacist system."

**Ferguson**: Protests erupt after Michael Brown's shooting. Some initial claims prove inaccurate. Shapiro's interpretation: "A lot of it was made up," and Obama's response created division.

Now contrast this with how Shapiro treats conservative grievances:

**IRS "targeting"**: Shapiro treats this as an established scandal, though investigations found progressive groups were also scrutinized and no criminal charges resulted.

**"Bitter clingers"**: Obama's comment about economically struggling communities is treated as sneering at religious, gun-owning Americans—not as a (perhaps clumsy) acknowledgment of how economic abandonment affects political behavior.

**Treatment of Trump**: Shapiro views the New York prosecution of Trump as politically motivated, though Trump was convicted by a jury. He's more willing to see prosecutorial overreach here than in any case involving police conduct.

There is a pattern here: When conservatives feel aggrieved, Shapiro validates the feeling, echoing the irritation at the commentary and how it reflects justifiable commentary. When Black Americans or progressives express grievance based on actual harm or injustice (being killed or arrested), he demands they first prove perfect factual accuracy in every detail, and even then questions their motivations.

## Ben Shapiro's selective narrative around the Ferguson and Jan 6th Riots

Shapiro characterized the Ferguson protests as driven by delusional anger and described protesters as utopian visionaries with violent thugs as their minions [[Ferguson's Days of Rage](https://www.frontpagemag.com/ferguson-days-rage-ben-shapiro/)]. His language was exceptionally harsh. He called it a situation driven by a media-manufactured story about a racial killing, and compared Ferguson protesters to radical Muslims rioting over cartoons of Mohammed. He wrote that protesters in Ferguson need an external enemy to justify their own failure to make good in the freest country in the history of humanity - consistent with his current thesis of 'scavengers'. He described the protesters as having delusional anger and stated that facts become secondary to emotion when dealing with these Ragers. [He accused the Ferguson community of lying](https://creators.com/read/ben-shapiro/12/14/the-real-racist-conspiracy-in-ferguson), facilitating lying, or intimidating witnesses in order to put an innocent man behind bars because he happened to be white. 

In contrast, Shapiro's characterization of January 6th was notably more measured and defensive, finding exhaustive caveats and arguments that minimized the impact or malicious intent of the participants. Moreover he claimed that January 6th was an exception since ["Republicans don't tend to riot in general"](https://www.mediamatters.org/ben-shapiro/ben-shapiro-republicans-dont-tend-riot-general). Furthermore, he compared it favorably to BLM riots, noting Jan 6 resulted in one direct death and about 1.5 million in property damage to the Capitol building, while BLM riots (which constituted more than one event) resulted in some 2 billion in insured property damage and two dozen deaths 

There are key differences that reveal an underlying bias:

**1. Moral characterization:** Ferguson protesters were characterized as having "delusional anger" and "failure to make good," while January 6th participants were described more neutrally as rioters, with many just "gawking" or being "sightseers."

**2. Systemic framing:** Ferguson was portrayed as driven by a false narrative and media manipulation, while January 6th was framed as having legitimate grievances that were being censored by media and Democrats.

**3. Comparisons used:** Ferguson protesters were compared to Islamic terrorists and radical Muslims, while January 6th was compared favorably to BLM protests to minimize its severity.

**4. Attribution of responsibility:** The entire Ferguson community was accused of conspiring to lie, while January 6th participants were often portrayed as individuals, with distinctions made between violent and non-violent actors.

**5. Tone about consequences:** Shapiro seemed satisfied that Ferguson "Ragers" would face consequences, but expressed support for many January 6th pardons, saying he had personal friends who were investigated and celebrated their pardons.

The presence of a double standard seems evident: racially-motivated protests are characterized as driven by delusion and failure, while a violent attempt to disrupt the certification of a democratic election is minimized as "gawking" and an "exception" to Republican behavior.

## **Shapiro's historical argument - What's Missing **

Shapiro talks about the foundation of Western Civilization being Judeo-Christian Morals and Greek Rationality, but crucial innovation that actually enabled Western technological and economic dominance: the development of systematic empiricism and the scientific method during the Renaissance and Enlightenment.

Greek philosophy gave us logical reasoning. Christianity gave us certain ethical frameworks. But neither provided a systematic way to generate *new* knowledge about the natural world. That came from figures like Bacon, Galileo, and Newton who insisted that theories must be tested against observation and experiment.

This matters for Shapiro's framework because empiricism is fundamentally about challenging received wisdom—including religious and philosophical dogma—through evidence. The scientific revolution succeeded precisely by questioning authorities like Aristotle and the Church when their claims conflicted with observable evidence.

So when Shapiro criticizes people for questioning economic or social structures, he's actually arguing *against* the very principle that made Western civilization successful: the willingness to test claims against evidence and revise beliefs accordingly.

If you claim to value Western civilization's achievements, you should value the empirical method that produced them. That means:

**Evaluating claims based on evidence, not authority**: When someone says 'the system is unfair,' don't dismiss it as 'scavenger mentality'—look at the data on social mobility, wage stagnation, wealth concentration, etc.
**Updating beliefs when evidence changes**: Shapiro demands perfect factual accuracy from Ferguson protesters but doesn't apply the same standard to conservative narratives. Real empiricism requires consistency.
**Recognizing that critique drives progress**: Science advances by questioning existing theories. Similarly, social progress requires questioning existing arrangements—that's not 'tearing down civilization,' it's how civilization improves.

Shapiro talks about Western civilization while ignoring the empirical method that actually made it successful. He wants the fruits of Enlightenment rationalism without its commitment to evidence-based reasoning.

## **Moving Forward**

If we are to attempt to find common ground, Shapiro is right to move beyond endless grievance without solutions. But the way he weighs into the discussion, primarily driving bias and double standards does more harm than good. In particular, his assertions about private ownership leading to prosperity and freedom *no matter how they are implemented *reveals that his premise is overly simple and does not truly drive a problem-solving approach.  

The "lions and scavengers" framework fails because it short-circuits the process of addressing problems intelligently. It transforms policy debates into character judgments. And by applying its standards selectively based on tribal loyalty, it becomes exactly what it claims to oppose: a way to validate your side's grievances while dismissing the other's.

If we want better than that—and I hope that Shapiro genuinely does beyond selling books and exercising power—we need frameworks based on measurable, objective fact that treat political opponents as people with different views about how to build a better society, not as moral inferiors trying to tear civilization down.

## **Appendix A - Systematic **Racial Disparities in the United States:

## Employment Discrimination

The evidence on hiring discrimination is robust and consistent:

**Resume/Name Studies:**

The landmark 2003 Bertrand-Mullainathan study found that job applicants with white-sounding names needed to send about 10 resumes to get one callback, while those with African-American-sounding names needed to send around 15 resumes - a 50% gap in callback rates [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/11/1243713272/resume-bias-study-white-names-black-names)[NBER](https://www.nber.org/digest/sep03/employers-replies-racial-names)
A 2024 update involving 83,000 fake applications to Fortune 500 companies found the typical employer called back presumably white applicants around 9% more than Black ones, with some firms showing gaps up to 24% [White-sounding names get called back for jobs more than Black ones, a new study finds](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/11/1243713272/resume-bias-study-white-names-black-names)
The original study also found that having a better resume helped white applicants much more than Black applicants - whites with higher quality resumes received 30% more callbacks, but the positive impact for African-American names was much smaller [Employers' Replies to Racial Names | NBER](https://www.nber.org/digest/sep03/employers-replies-racial-names)

## Wealth Gaps

The racial wealth disparities are stark and persistent:

**Overall Wealth:**

In 2021, households with a White householder had 10 times more wealth than those with a Black householder [Households With a White, Non-Hispanic Householder Were Ten Times Wealthier Than Those With a Black Householder in 2021](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2024/04/wealth-by-race.html)
White households made up 65.3% of all U.S. households and held 80.0% of all wealth, while Black households made up 13.6% of households but held only 4.7% of all wealth [Households With a White, Non-Hispanic Householder Were Ten Times Wealthier Than Those With a Black Householder in 2021](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2024/04/wealth-by-race.html)
In 2022, the average wealth of white families reached over $1.3 million, compared to about $227,000 for Hispanic families and $211,000 for Black families - a gap exceeding $1 million for the first time [A $1 million wealth gap now divides white families from Black and Hispanic ones, research shows](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/1-million-wealth-gap-white-black-hispanic-families-rcna149252)
Asian households had a median net worth of $320,900 in 2021, compared with $250,400 for White households, $48,700 for Hispanic households, and $27,100 for Black households [How Black, Hispanic, Asian, White households compare in wealth | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/2023/12/04/wealth-gaps-across-racial-and-ethnic-groups/)

**Despite Growth, Gaps Widening:**

Between 2019 and 2022, wealth for the typical Black family rose 61% and for the typical Hispanic family it rose 47%, while the typical White family saw a 31% increase [The Fed - Greater Wealth, Greater Uncertainty: Changes in Racial Inequality in the Survey of Consumer Finances](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/greater-wealth-greater-uncertainty-changes-in-racial-inequality-in-the-survey-of-consumer-finances-20231018.html)
However, both the White-Black and White-Hispanic median wealth gaps increased by around $50,000 between 2019 and 2022, with each gap reaching over $220,000 in 2022, because Black and Hispanic families had less wealth to start with [The Fed - Greater Wealth, Greater Uncertainty: Changes in Racial Inequality in the Survey of Consumer Finances](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/greater-wealth-greater-uncertainty-changes-in-racial-inequality-in-the-survey-of-consumer-finances-20231018.html)

## Mechanisms Behind Wealth Gaps

**Homeownership:**

Homeownership is the primary driver of wealth-building in the U.S., and continues to lag for Black families in particular because of the stubborn legacy of racist housing policies [A $1 million wealth gap now divides white families from Black and Hispanic ones, research shows](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/1-million-wealth-gap-white-black-hispanic-families-rcna149252)
In 2018, the Black-white homeownership gap reached 30.5 percentage points, its highest level in 50 years, and Black Americans remain the only racial group with a homeownership rate below 50 percent [Nine Charts about Wealth Inequality in America](https://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/)

**Intergenerational Transfers:**

In 2022, white families were nearly four times more likely to receive an inheritance than Black families and about five times more likely than Hispanic families [Nine Charts about Wealth Inequality in America](https://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/)
By some estimates, bequests and transfers account for at least half of aggregate wealth and account for more of the racial wealth gap than any other demographic or socioeconomic indicator [The Fed - Disparities in Wealth by Race and Ethnicity in the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/disparities-in-wealth-by-race-and-ethnicity-in-the-2019-survey-of-consumer-finances-20200928.html)

**Asset Composition:**

Households with a White householder were more likely than households with a Black householder to own all asset types, and median values were higher - for example, checking/savings account values were 5.4 times larger [Households With a White, Non-Hispanic Householder Were Ten Times Wealthier Than Those With a Black Householder in 2021](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2024/04/wealth-by-race.html)
Between 2019 and 2022, stock equity made up nearly 30% of white wealth but only 4% of Black wealth, indicative of intergenerational wealth divides resulting in the average white family possessing more investment capital [Black wealth is increasing, but so is the racial wealth gap | Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/black-wealth-is-increasing-but-so-is-the-racial-wealth-gap/)

**Debt Burden:**

Households with a Black householder were more likely than those with a White householder to have unsecured debt (61.3% vs. 53.4%), especially student loan debt (25.8% vs. 17.2%) and medical debt (22.5% vs. 13.4%) [Households With a White, Non-Hispanic Householder Were Ten Times Wealthier Than Those With a Black Householder in 2021](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2024/04/wealth-by-race.html)

## **Appendix B - ****Wealth Inequality Trends **

## Overall Wealth Inequality is Increasing

**Long-term trend:**
In 1963, the wealthiest families had 36 times the wealth of families in the middle of the wealth distribution. By 2022, they had 71 times the wealth of families in the middle [Nine Charts about Wealth Inequality in America](https://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/)

The uninterrupted increase in inequality since 1980 has caused concern among members of the public, researchers, policymakers and politicians [Trends in U.S. income and wealth inequality | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/)

**Recent acceleration:**

## Concentration at the Top

**Current distribution:**
As of 2024, the top 10% of households by wealth held 67.2% of total household wealth, while the bottom 50% held only 2.5% of total household wealth [St. Louis Fed](https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2024/feb/us-wealth-inequality-widespread-gains-gaps-remain)[Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/203961/wealth-distribution-for-the-us/)

**Historical comparison:**
The share of America's wealth held by the nation's wealthiest peaked in the late 1920s before the Great Depression, then fell by more than half over the next three decades, but the equalizing trends of the mid-20th century have now been almost completely undone - the richest now hold as large a wealth share as they did in the 1920s [USAPP](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/inequalities/2025/01/02/ten-facts-about-wealth-inequality-in-the-usa/)[Inequality.org](https://inequality.org/facts/wealth-inequality/)

**Within the wealthy:**
In 1982, rich Americans needed $240 million (in 2024 dollars) to enter the Forbes 400, with an average of $730 million. In 2024, entry required at least $3.3 billion, with the average member holding over $13 billion - nearly 18 times the 1982 average after adjusting for inflation [Wealth Inequality - Inequality.org](https://inequality.org/facts/wealth-inequality/)

## Wage and Income Stagnation

**Productivity vs. compensation:**
From 1979 to 2024, average hourly compensation increased just 29.4% (after adjusting for inflation) while worker productivity increased 80.9% [Income Inequality - Inequality.org](https://inequality.org/facts/income-inequality/)

**Unequal gains:**
Between 1980 and 2022, the bottom 90% of U.S. earners had wage growth of just 36%, compared to 162% for the richest 1% and 301% for the top 0.1% [Income Inequality - Inequality.org](https://inequality.org/facts/income-inequality/)

## Asset Ownership Disparities

**Stock ownership:**
The richest 1% own 50% of U.S. stock and mutual funds, up from 40% in 2002 [Wealth Inequality - Inequality.org](https://inequality.org/facts/wealth-inequality/)

America's top 1% holds more than half the national wealth invested in stocks and mutual funds, while the bulk of their wealth comes from different and more lucrative asset sources than everyone else [Ten facts about wealth inequality in the USA - LSE Inequalities](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/inequalities/2025/01/02/ten-facts-about-wealth-inequality-in-the-usa/)

## Pandemic Period

**Billionaire gains:**
The collective net worth of America's top 12 billionaires increased by more than $1.3 trillion, or 193%, between March 18, 2020 and December 3, 2024, even during the most intense period of the pandemic [USAPP](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/inequalities/2025/01/02/ten-facts-about-wealth-inequality-in-the-usa/)[Inequality.org](https://inequality.org/facts/wealth-inequality/)

**Temporary narrowing:**
Between 2019 and 2022, the wealthiest families' wealth dropped from 91 to 71 times middle-class families' wealth - the only other time wealth inequality decreased since 1963 was between 1989 and 1995 [Nine Charts about Wealth Inequality in America](https://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/)

## Political Influence

According to Americans for Tax Fairness analysis, 100 billionaire families spent $2.6 billion, or 16.5% of total political contributions in 2024. In 2000, billionaire election spending came to just $18 million, or 0.6% of total political contributions [Wealth Inequality - Inequality.org](https://inequality.org/facts/wealth-inequality/)

## **Wealth inequality is increasing and becoming more severe.** 

The evidence shows:

**It's at historic levels** - approaching the inequality of the 1920s pre-Great Depression era
**It's accelerating** - particularly since 1980, and dramatically in recent years
**Gains are extremely concentrated** - the very top is pulling away not just from the bottom, but even from the merely wealthy
**The middle is falling behind** - the wealth ratio between top and middle has nearly doubled since the 1960s
**Workers' wages have decoupled from productivity** - the economic gains go increasingly to capital owners rather than workers

This directly supports your point that the system is "becoming more so" unfair in terms of economic outcomes, even as absolute living standards have risen for many.

Some federal job applications now ask about an applicant's alignment with presidential policy priorities, with questions like "How would you help advance the President's Executive Orders and policy priorities in this role?" which critics call a blatant loyalty test [Salon](https://www.salon.com/2025/06/07/loyalty-is-now-part-of-job-application/)[Government Executive](https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/06/lynch-opms-hiring-plan-includes-blatant-loyalty-test/405740/)

Even positions as meteorologists at the National Weather Service are now asking applicants about their views on executive orders and the Constitution, which Senator Markey condemned as a loyalty test that puts politics over qualifications for mission-critical jobs [Senator Markey Condemns President Trump's "Loyalty Test" that Puts Politics over Qualifications for Mission-Critical National Weather Service Job Candidates | U.S. Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts](https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/-senator-markey-condemns-president-trumps-loyalty-test-that-puts-politics-over-qualifications-for-mission-critical-national-weather-service-job-candidates)

**Career Civil Service:**
The Trump administration is reshaping federal agencies by making more employees politically appointed and ensuring career executives are evaluated based on how well they implement the president's agenda [Trump to convert some top career roles to political appointments and evaluate execs on adherence to president's agenda - Government Executive](https://www.govexec.com/management/2025/02/trump-convert-governments-top-career-roles-political-appointments-and-evaluate-execs-adherence-presidents-agenda/403277/)

The guidance suggests that career federal executives cannot be trusted to fulfill their responsibilities, which the Senior Executives Association president said would ensure policy-related positions can only be filled by the administration's political cronies [Trump to convert some top career roles to political appointments and evaluate execs on adherence to president's agenda - Government Executive](https://www.govexec.com/management/2025/02/trump-convert-governments-top-career-roles-political-appointments-and-evaluate-execs-adherence-presidents-agenda/403277/)

## Trump's Own Statements

When announcing lawyer Alina Habba as counselor to the president, Trump stated: "She has been unwavering in her loyalty, and unmatched in her resolve - standing with me through numerous 'trials,' battles, and countless days in Court" [Trump administration tracker shows his latest top staff picks for his 2025 term](https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/trump-administration-nominees-2025/)

Trump learned from his first term when he elevated people he was barely acquainted with, which left him distrusting of people around him and spiraling over perceived lack of loyalty, and has since described some early personnel selections as "the biggest mistake I made" [Trump's Cabinet picks face tests of loyalty during upcoming confirmation hearings | CNN Politics](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/12/politics/trump-cabinet-loyalty-test-confirmation-hearings/index.html)

## The Contrast with "Meritocracy"

This is devastating for Shapiro's claim that Trump represents meritocracy. The evidence shows:

**Systematic prioritization of loyalty over qualifications** - acknowledged even by Reuters and CFR
**Surprise appointments** based on personal relationship rather than vetting
**Lack of relevant experience** in positions requiring enormous expertise
**Institutionalized loyalty testing** even for non-political civil service positions
**Trump's own explicit statements** valuing loyalty above all else

This directly contradicts any claim that Trump's administration represents merit-based advancement. It's the opposite - it's a patronage system based on personal loyalty to Trump himself.

## Appendix D - Direct Comparison: Ferguson Protests vs. January 6th Capitol Riot

Based on official investigations and impartial reporting, here's what actually happened at both events:

## **Ferguson Protests (2014)**

**Context and Causes:**
The Department of Justice investigation found that the Ferguson Police Department engaged in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the First, Fourth, and 14th Amendments, including conducting stops without reasonable suspicion, arrests without probable cause, and using unreasonable force [U.S. Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-findings-two-civil-rights-investigations-ferguson-missouri)[Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edmo/pr/justice-department-announces-findings-two-civil-rights-investigations-ferguson-missouri). The investigation found racial bias was intentional, with the harms of Ferguson's police and court practices borne disproportionately by African Americans, who accounted for 85 percent of vehicle stops, 90 percent of citations, and 93 percent of arrests despite making up only 67 percent of the population [Office of Public Affairs | Justice Department Announces Findings of Two Civil Rights Investigations in Ferguson, Missouri | United States Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-findings-two-civil-rights-investigations-ferguson-missouri).

**Nature of Protests:**
Along with peaceful protests, there was a significant amount of looting and violence in the vicinity of the site of the shooting [Ferguson unrest - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson_unrest). More than 170 protests sprouted up across the country, and unlike the violence that erupted in Ferguson on Monday night, most of the demonstrations were peaceful [Ferguson protests spread coast to coast](https://www.cnn.com/2014/11/26/us/national-ferguson-demonstrations). There were calls among protesters for peace and for people to refrain from looting, but peaceful protests slid into violence with some protesters throwing bottles and rocks [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson_unrest)[STLPR](https://www.stlpr.org/politics-issues/2014-11-25/peaceful-protests-slide-into-violence-in-ferguson-far-less-damage-in-shaw).

**Police Response:**
Media criticism of the militarization of the police in Ferguson after the shooting was frequent [Ferguson unrest - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson_unrest). A DOJ report found that the police response offers lessons in how not to handle mass demonstrations, with poor community-police relations, ineffective communication among the more than 50 law enforcement agencies that responded, police orders that infringed on First Amendment rights, and military-style tactics that antagonized demonstrators [STLPR](https://www.stlpr.org/government-politics-issues/2015-09-02/justice-department-report-finds-uncoordinated-police-response-to-ferguson-protests)[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-department-report-on-ferguson-unrest-offers-lessons-in-what-not-to-do/). The DOJ found that the Ferguson police department had virtually no established community relationship with the residents, which negatively impacted the response of all agencies involved [Justice Department report finds uncoordinated police response to Ferguson protests | STLPR](https://www.stlpr.org/government-politics-issues/2015-09-02/justice-department-report-finds-uncoordinated-police-response-to-ferguson-protests).

## **January 6th Capitol Riot (2021)**

**Context and Intent:**
According to the bipartisan House select committee that investigated the incident, the attack was the culmination of a plan by Trump to overturn the election, with supporters seeking to keep him in power by preventing a joint session of Congress from counting the Electoral College votes to formalize the victory of president-elect Joe Biden [January 6 United States Capitol attack - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack).

**Violence Against Police:**
About 140 police officers were injured when they were trampled, had objects thrown at them, and sprayed with chemical irritants during the insurrection, with roughly 114 US Capitol Police officers reporting injuries [CNN](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2022/03/07/politics/capitol-police-injuries/index.html)[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack). Officers were beaten with bats, struck with flagpoles, pinned against statues, clobbered with wrenches, hit with bear spray, with injuries including swollen ankles and wrists, bruised arms and legs, concussions and irritated lungs [Beaten, sprayed with mace and hit with stun guns: police describe injuries to dozens of officers during assault on U.S. Capitol](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/police-capitol-injuires-trump/2021/01/11/ca68e3e2-5438-11eb-a08b-f1381ef3d207_story.html). More than 150 officers were injured in the attack: 86 Capitol Police officers and 65 members of the Metropolitan Police Department, with even more officers sustaining injuries they did not even bother to report [At least 17 police officers remain out of work with injuries from the Capitol attack - CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/capitol-police-injuries-riot/).

Officers described hand-to-hand combat, being dragged down stairs, and one officer said he could feel himself losing oxygen and recalled thinking this is how I'm going to die, defending this entrance [Electrocuted, beaten, abused: Capitol Police recall their own 'vulnerability' on Jan. 6](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/electrocuted-beaten-abused-capitol-police-recall-their-own-vulnerability-on-jan-6). Within 36 hours, five people died: one was shot by Capitol Police, another died of a drug overdose, and three died of natural causes, including a police officer who died of a stroke a day after being assaulted by rioters; four other police officers committed suicide in the days and months after [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack)[FactCheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2021/11/how-many-died-as-a-result-of-capitol-riot/).

**Police Response:**
Capitol Police leadership had not planned for a riot or attack, and on January 6, under orders from leadership, the force deployed without riot gear, shields, batons, or less lethal arms such as sting grenades [January 6 United States Capitol attack - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack). Police units were not asked by management to bring protective equipment such as gas masks that were issued to them, which left officers ill-prepared to fend off the rioters who were armed with bear spray and stun grenades and equipped with two-way radios and earpieces [Law enforcement response to the January 6 United States Capitol attack - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_response_to_the_January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack).

## **Key Differences**

**1. Legitimacy of Grievances:**

Ferguson: DOJ confirmed systemic constitutional violations by police
January 6: No evidence of election fraud; rioters sought to overturn legitimate election results

**2. Violence Against Police:**

Ferguson: Some protesters threw bottles and rocks at police in militarized riot gear
January 6: 140+ officers injured, some nearly killed in hand-to-hand combat; 4 officers later died by suicide

**3. Intent:**

Ferguson: Protests against documented police brutality and racial discrimination
January 6: Violent attempt to prevent constitutional transfer of power

**4. Police Conduct:**

Ferguson: Police militarization and excessive force criticized; violated First Amendment rights
January 6: Police were undermanned, under-equipped, and fought desperately to protect lawmakers

**5. Scale of Organized Violence:**

Ferguson: Sporadic looting and property damage alongside mostly peaceful protests nationwide
January 6: Coordinated assault on the U.S. Capitol with militia groups using military tactics

The impartial evidence shows Ferguson involved protests (some violent, most peaceful) against documented systemic injustice, while January 6 was an organized violent attack to overturn democracy that resulted in far more severe injuries to law enforcement.
