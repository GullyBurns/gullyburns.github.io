An iconic line from &#8216;Batman, the Dark
Knight Rises&#8217; embodies a sentiment so cruel and abusive that it shook me. The
line is &#8220;*You have my permission to die*&#8221;, first triumphantly spoken by Bane
after snapping Batman&#8217;s spine in single combat as a monologue revealing his dastardly plans for Gotham. This was
glorious stuff, a key moment in the story where Bane stands with complete power
over his adversary, choosing his words carefully to inflict as much despair as
he can on his helpless victim. This is a man devoid of humanity, a monster
worth fighting, a Bad Guy.

Now, this wasn&#8217;t the thing that
bothered me. The thing that made me stop and think &#8216;hold on a second there&#8217; was
when the tables were turned. When, on the steps of City Hall, Batman (now
recovered from his spinal injury) fights Bane *mano-a-mano*, and wholly defeats him. Standing over his wheezing,
pathetic-looking body, Batman re-echoes Bane&#8217;s words: &#8220;*You now have my
permission to die*&#8221;. At the time of writing this essay (2013), the phrase has become an online meme, echoed by anyone seeking a quick laugh at the melodrama of its overblown callousness. 

Thinking a little deeper, I&#8217;d say that this was the moment Batman
lost. He lost by becoming as cruel and heartless as his enemy. Naturally, the logic is that Bane deserved it, he was
simply getting his just desserts. Payback&#8217;s a bitch.

Another line, this time from
Nietzsche, springs to mind: *&#8220;Battle not with monsters, lest you
become a monster.&#8221;*

The theme of &#8216;good but badass&#8217; heroes is
ridiculously common in action movies. Tough, ruthless men and women: warriors, mercenaries,
soldiers, cops, spies, bodyguards, commandos, ninja, assassins and hitmen are
frequently portrayed as heroes. The distinguishing feature they possess are [a very particular set of skills](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgmO32IdwuE) that usually come down to the ability to kill people (and
to look sexy doing it). They are Good Guys. They kill Bad Guys.
Sometimes in a spectacular fashion that elicits cheers and applause from movie-goers.
This could be a beheading, a knife through the crown of the skull or perhaps an
explosive detonated within their adversary&#8217;s body just after the bad guy
realizes what is about to happen. The image of &#8216;a good guy with a gun&#8217; is
glorified and eulogized, enshrined in legend and admired by lots of people,
copied by some in their choice of profession or their own self image.

Shakespeare&#8217;s bloodiest play, Titus
Andronicus, is an object lesson about cycles of violence and vengeance: an eye
for an eye, a rape for a death, a mutilation here, a little cannibalism there.
One must admit that the bard went a little berserk at the end there, but the
underlying theme is pretty clear. Payback is a bitch and an uncaring, undiscerning one at that. Violence inflicted on your enemies will in turn evolve into violence
inflicted on you and the moral arguments you might try to use to continue
justifying retribution become ever weaker as you continue. Moreover, the
situation perennially escalates, becoming more entrenched as you progress. Once
you start with vengeance, you will find it harder to stop. This is the tragedy that gets played out again and again in places like Israel, Iraq, Turkey, Algeria, Belfast, and even on the streets of my home: Los Angeles. Men fight and men die based on the same tired, empty, cycles of revenge and retribution.

If these people have heroes, they are as the ancient Greeks
imagined them: Hector and Achilles, cutting through swathes of enemies to wade
in their blood, gloriously terrible and beyond the scope of lesser men. To me,
these people aren&#8217;t heroes, but bullies, driven by ego and a need to dominate
and overpower others. 

Consider an alternative 'school of heroism', where evil
can be confronted by intelligence, force (if necessary) but always by humanity,
decency and goodness. 

Consider Harry Potter.

There&#8217;s a moment in HP7 when Harry is
fending off the evil machinations of the dastardly Draco Malfoy. They&#8217;re flying
around the Room of Requirement and someone starts a fire which traps and
threatens to engulf Malfoy. Harry then places his own life in danger to rescue Draco,
just simply because it&#8217;s the right thing to do. At a later stage, when
Voldemort has supposedly killed Harry, Malfoy&#8217;s mother examines his body to
find he&#8217;s still alive and she lies about it to Voldemort. Why? *Because he had saved the life of her son*.

This embodies the sentiment expressed by Abraham Lincoln when he said: *&#8220;Am I not destroying my enemies when I make friends of them?&#8221;*. By steadfastly
holding on to his decency, even in the face of all manner of provoking circumstances, Harry provides an exit route from this steadily spiraling cycle of violence, as similarly demonstrated by Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela. 

An important aspect of the notion of
heroism is that it presents idealized people who we admire and aspire to
emulate. I wonder how many professional murderers chose their profession because
of James Bond, the Godfather, Scarface, American Sniper or maybe even Batman.

We need to choose our heroes wisely. I
choose Harry Potter.
