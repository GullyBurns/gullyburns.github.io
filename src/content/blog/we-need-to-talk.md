On a micro- and a macro-level, the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination has been revelatory. From the jaw-dropping gall of the Trump administration's flagrant attempts to capitalize on the anger and shock of the moment to target and silence anyone who disagrees with them; to my own experiences of interacting with people in the comments sections of articles, Bluesky, and X. It seems clear that the present moment holds some valuable lessons, if only we can stop, pay attention, and learn new ways to challenge our current circumstances.

To me, the most revelatory discussions center around the work of Ezra Klein in the New York Times. He has generated three pieces in the aftermath of Kirk's killing: (a) an article on the day after the shooting:"Charlie Kirk as pursuing Politics the Right Way" that praised Kirk as a persuasive political operative, (b) a follow-up that focused and emphasized the importance of political argument with people from the other side (including a very recent interview with Ben Shapiro); and (c) a substantive and thoroughly excellent discussion with Governor Spencer Cox from Utah. Governor Cox has been acting as the primary political spokesperson for Charlie Kirk's murder 'on the ground' in Utah and has been one of the few conservative voices calling for calm and trying to calm everyone down.   

The clear, unambiguous point that Ezra Klein has been making has been that we must reinstate political argumentation across the political left and right and re-engage with each other. There is a rising tide of political violence that is symptomatic of a deeper alienation between the two sides and has the potential of being disastrous for America as a country in the very near future.

Personally, I would claim that Trump's election in 2016 and in 2024 are clear evidence of that already - but now, I fear, the worst is yet to come for the unfolding disaster that we are all facing day-by-day in the USA in 2025.   

These articles and podcasts attracted a lot of criticism from progressives, who were clearly frustrated with Ezra Klein's tone. In his first article, published the day after the murder, he was civil, generous, warm even. 

In my own online discussions, it was immediately apparent that this was unacceptable to many people in my circle. The pervading perception was a strongly negative portrayal of Kirk as a polemicist, a pure antagonist for almost every progressive position, and a generally evil person. Any sense of moderation was met with derision, dismissal, and personal attack. In these interactions, it felt like the goal was simply to dismiss my point of view, shut me down, and shut me up.

I feel, that in this moment, Ezra Klein is onto something. Many of the rebuttals and counter-arguments being published name him directly, and the fact that he is attracting such a strong reaction is telling.

Why could that be?

The majority of criticism for his approach seems to be that acknowledging Kirk's effectiveness with his audience in any positive light somehow legitimizes what Kirk was doing (see Notes below). In his articles, Klein seemed quite level-headed, accurate, and critical of some of the actions that Kirk had taken (such as creating a list of academics to persecute, calling for the execution of Joe Biden, etc). He always maintained a tone of civil discussion, never adopting the approach of a moralistic condemnation that could only block off and destroy the possibility of future debate. 

This is the key issue.

Listening to Ezra's Klein's interviews, he gives his subjects a great deal of deference and allows them to speak extensively. He does not attempt to browbeat them into submission. He doesn't try to 'win' the argument through rhetorical tricks, volume, moralistic posturing or even raising his voice. He just lets them talk. 

This is excellent - and very much in-keeping with his apparent mission of having people on the left and right have meaningful and productive arguments with each other. 

When the most objectionable people on his show are required to actually explain their political positions, it becomes very clear just how weak and frankly bizarre many of them are. Not only that, but many of the interactions are incredibly insightful to help all of us understand the other. Just why do right-wingers frame their thoughts in this way? Why do they support Trump even now? What is the real motivation for their thinking? 

Providing such a resource for us all is incredibly valuable. 

Having said that, I find myself reacting with annoyance to his interviews. They feel somewhat anodyne, polite, and shallow. A really good argument really gets into the meat of something and he only ever makes individual counterpoints before moving on. But, he does make the counterpoint in the moment and still manages to keep the conversation going. Would going deeper run the risk becoming so contentious that people would stop participating? This is the fine line Mr Kline navigates expertly in these interviews. I&#8217;d like to believe that this is deliberate whilst being backed by a full-throated commitment to the same kinds of viewpoints that I share, but it&#8217;s hard to tell.

The other interesting side effect of these discussions, however annoying, is that they spur people to write, to criticize, and further engage. Being annoyed is good in this context. It makes us want to respond and further the conversation.

A moralistic reaction that we shouldn&#8217;t talk to &#8216;*these people&#8217;* because they are evil kills conversion and blocks any effort to even try to persuade them. Even though we may never succeed in that persuasion, the fact that these discussions are happening in public serves to promote discourse in onlookers. 
In the words of Hal Wyner from season 1 of Netflix&#8217;s The Diplomat (an entirely fictional character) &#8220;*One of the boneheaded truisms of foreign policy is that talking to your enemies legitimizes them.Talk to everyone. Talk to the dictator, and the war criminal. Talk to the poor schmuck three levels down who's so pissed he has to sit in the back of the second car, he may be ready to turn. Talk to terrorists. Talk to everyone. Fail, and fail again. And brush yourself off. And fail again. Because maybe... Maybe&#8230;&#8221;.*

We have to talk. It is essential. It&#8217;s the only way we exert our power in this situation. When we do talk, we need to do it well - perhaps through better ways to argue that use modern AI to help find authentic solutions. We have to make the argument for honesty, compassion, and understanding more compelling than the one currently employed by our adversaries- those arguing for lies, cruelty, and blind faith. 

Our future depends on it.
