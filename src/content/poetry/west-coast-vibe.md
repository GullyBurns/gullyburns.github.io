The grey is grounding,
After all, it *is* December.
Standing here 
In workout clothes
On the beach in Santa Monica
And not freezing.

I look out over the Pacific
Amid the beach's paraphernalia 
Restrained from exuberance
By the light drizzle.
I watch the Ferris wheel,
Bright and gaudy
Unmistakably childish
With a west-coast 
Commitment to
A non-serious vibe.

I think a little of 
An English grey
A little harder than this:
Slick, hard pavements
Wet and cold after the rain,
And I smile.
