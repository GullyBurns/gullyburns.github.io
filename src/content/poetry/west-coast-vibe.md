The grey is grounding,

After all, it *is* December.

Standing here 

In workout clothes

On the beach in Santa Monica

And not freezing.

I look out over the Pacific

Amid the beach's paraphernalia 

Restrained from exuberance

By the light drizzle.

I watch the Ferris wheel,

Bright and gaudy

Unmistakably childish

With a west-coast 

Commitment to

A non-serious vibe.

I think a little of 

An English grey

A little harder than this:

Slick, hard pavements

Wet and cold after the rain,

And I smile.
