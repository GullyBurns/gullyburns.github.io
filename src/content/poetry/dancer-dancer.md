Sparks of light uncoil from you
As, moving, you unleash a grace,
That swirls and cascades through the air
Weaving poetry in space.

The cadence of your movement,
The flutter in your spine,
Are far more simply eloquent
Than these poor words of mine.

Since language is a recent thing
And written words are tame
Your speech is ancient, wild, and bright
A song wrought out of flame.
