Sparks of light uncoil from you

As, moving, you unleash a grace,

That swirls and cascades through the air

Weaving poetry in space.

The cadence of your movement,

The flutter in your spine,

Are far more simply eloquent

Than these poor words of mine.

Since I can only try to please

With clever little rhymes,

But you, in flowing elegance,

Breathe life, make love, stop time.
