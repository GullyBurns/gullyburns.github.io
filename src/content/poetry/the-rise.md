Beginning in ashes,

Amid smoke and flame,

We crouch, weighed down

And pinned to the ground

By our hurt, broken hopes and our shame 

It is then, when we find

Amid ashes and dust,

Small good things still smoldering

Deserving of shouldering

By effort and work and our trust.

Let us stand, let us rise

Amid others' contempt.

Grow our wings in the rising

Our brightness now shining 

Resurrected just by the attempt.
