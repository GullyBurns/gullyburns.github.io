I am a point mass

Swept up in the flow of folk

Conducted by boys in blue.

Do drops of water have take off their shoes, I wonder?

Do they become strangely uneasy when others move faster than they.

Do they make idle conversation, loitering in tide pools?

I am a point mass,

One amongst many,

To be shuffled and sorted and guided.

I regain my humanity only when I arrive.
