To run in darkness is to touch the night.
Quiet bodies moving lithely,
Cushioned and smoothed: Reebok on asphalt,
In an unlit LA driveway,
As a down-to-the-street-and-back
Piece of this evening's workout. 

And here, in this safe little patch of shadow, 
I think of what it must have been like 
To run in the dark a long time ago. 
With lives, perhaps, dependent on
Your hard, striding effort and breath hammering.
Feet slipping, enemies closing.

To run in darkness is to touch the night.
