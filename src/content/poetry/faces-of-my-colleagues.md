On a Zoom this week

Face-to-face with colleagues

Close up to grit and grace.

What an honor to see

The unvarnished fight

In their warriors&#8217; eyes.

Catching an occasional

Glint of lightness

In the conversation

Moved me most of all.

Amid this current moment

Perhaps I&#8217;m not alone

To look around

At my colleagues

And see the heroes there.
